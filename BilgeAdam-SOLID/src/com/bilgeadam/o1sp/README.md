# The Single Responsibility Principle
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should do one thing and therefore it should have only a single reason to change.

To state this principle more technically: Only one potential change (database logic, logging logic, and so on.) in the software’s specification should be able to affect the specification of the class.

This means that if a class is a data container, like a Book class or a Student class, and it has some fields regarding that entity, it should change only when we change the data model.

Following the Single Responsibility Principle is important. First of all, because many different teams can work on the same project and edit the same class for different reasons, this could lead to incompatible modules.

Second, it makes version control easier. For example, say we have a persistence class that handles database operations, and we see a change in that file in the GitHub commits. By following the SRP, we will know that it is related to storage or database-related stuff.

Merge conflicts are another example. They appear when different teams change the same file. But if the SRP is followed, fewer conflicts will appear – files will have a single reason to change, and conflicts that do exist will be easier to resolve.

## Common Pitfalls and Anti-patterns
In this section we will look at some common mistakes that violate the Single Responsibility Principle. Then we will talk about some ways to fix them.

We will look at the code for a simple bookstore invoice program as an example. Let's start by defining a book class to use in our invoice.

    class Book {
        String name;
        String authorName;
        int year;
        int price;
        String isbn;
        
            public Book(String name, String authorName, int year, int price, String isbn) {
                this.name = name;
                this.authorName = authorName;
                this.year = year;
                this.price = price;
                this.isbn = isbn;
            }
    }
This is a simple book class with some fields. Nothing fancy. I am not making fields private so that we don't need to deal with getters and setters and can focus on the logic instead.

Now let's create the invoice class which will contain the logic for creating the invoice and calculating the total price. For now, assume that our bookstore only sells books and nothing else.

    public class Invoice {

        private Book book;
        private int quantity;
        private double discountRate;
        private double taxRate;
        private double total;
    
        public Invoice(Book book, int quantity, double discountRate, double taxRate) {
            this.book = book;
            this.quantity = quantity;
            this.discountRate = discountRate;
            this.taxRate = taxRate;
            this.total = this.calculateTotal();
        }
    
        public double calculateTotal() {
                double price = ((book.price - book.price * discountRate) * this.quantity);
    
            double priceWithTaxes = price * (1 + taxRate);
    
            return priceWithTaxes;
        }
    
        public void printInvoice() {
                System.out.println(quantity + "x " + book.name + " " +          book.price + "$");
                System.out.println("Discount Rate: " + discountRate);
                System.out.println("Tax Rate: " + taxRate);
                System.out.println("Total: " + total);
        }
    
            public void saveToFile(String filename) {
        // Creates a file with given name and writes the invoice
        }

    }
Here is our invoice class. It also contains some fields about invoicing and 3 methods:

* calculateTotal method, which calculates the total price,
* printInvoice method, that should print the invoice to console, and
* saveToFile method, responsible for writing the invoice to a file.
You should give yourself a second to think about what is wrong with this class design before reading the next paragraph.

Ok so what's going on here? Our class violates the Single Responsibility Principle in multiple ways.

The first violation is the printInvoice method, which contains our printing logic. The SRP states that our class should only have a single reason to change, and that reason should be a change in the invoice calculation for our class.

But in this architecture, if we wanted to change the printing format, we would need to change the class. This is why we should not have printing logic mixed with business logic in the same class.

There is another method that violates the SRP in our class: the saveToFile method. It is also an extremely common mistake to mix persistence logic with business logic.

Don't just think in terms of writing to a file – it could be saving to a database, making an API call, or other stuff related to persistence.

So how can we fix this print function, you may ask.

We can create new classes for our printing and persistence logic so we will no longer need to modify the invoice class for those purposes.

We create 2 classes, InvoicePrinter and InvoicePersistence, and move the methods.

    public class InvoicePrinter {
        private Invoice invoice;
    
        public InvoicePrinter(Invoice invoice) {
            this.invoice = invoice;
        }
    
        public void print() {
            System.out.println(invoice.quantity + "x " + invoice.book.name + " " + invoice.book.price + " $");
            System.out.println("Discount Rate: " + invoice.discountRate);
            System.out.println("Tax Rate: " + invoice.taxRate);
            System.out.println("Total: " + invoice.total + " $");
        }
    }


    public class InvoicePersistence {
        Invoice invoice;
    
        public InvoicePersistence(Invoice invoice) {
            this.invoice = invoice;
        }
    
        public void saveToFile(String filename) {
            // Creates a file with given name and writes the invoice
        }
    }
Now our class structure obeys the Single Responsibility Principle and every class is responsible for one aspect of our application. Great!
