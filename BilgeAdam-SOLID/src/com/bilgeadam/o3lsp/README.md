# Liskov Substitution Principle
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that subclasses should be substitutable for their base classes.

This means that, given that class B is a subclass of class A, we should be able to pass an object of class B to any method that expects an object of class A and the method should not give any weird output in that case.

This is the expected behavior, because when we use inheritance we assume that the child class inherits everything that the superclass has. The child class extends the behavior but never narrows it down.

Therefore, when a class does not obey this principle, it leads to some nasty bugs that are hard to detect.

Liskov's principle is easy to understand but hard to detect in code. So let's look at an example.

    class Rectangle {
        protected int width, height;
    
        public Rectangle() {
        }
    
        public Rectangle(int width, int height) {
            this.width = width;
            this.height = height;
        }
    
        public int getWidth() {
            return width;
        }
    
        public void setWidth(int width) {
            this.width = width;
        }
    
        public int getHeight() {
            return height;
        }
    
        public void setHeight(int height) {
            this.height = height;
        }
    
        public int getArea() {
            return width * height;
        }
    }
We have a simple Rectangle class, and a getArea function which returns the area of the rectangle.

Now we decide to create another class for Squares. As you might know, a square is just a special type of rectangle where the width is equal to the height.

    class Square extends Rectangle {
        public Square() {}
    
        public Square(int size) {
            width = height = size;
        }
    
        @Override
        public void setWidth(int width) {
            super.setWidth(width);
            super.setHeight(width);
        }
    
        @Override
        public void setHeight(int height) {
            super.setHeight(height);
            super.setWidth(height);
        }
    }
Our Square class extends the Rectangle class. We set height and width to the same value in the constructor, but we do not want any client (someone who uses our class in their code) to change height or weight in a way that can violate the square property.

Therefore we override the setters to set both properties whenever one of them is changed. But by doing that we have just violated the Liskov substitution principle.

Let's create a main class to perform tests on the getArea function.

    class Test {
    
        static void getAreaTest(Rectangle r) {
            int width = r.getWidth();
            r.setHeight(10);
            System.out.println("Expected area of " + (width * 10) + ", got " + r.getArea());
        }
    
        public static void main(String[] args) {
            Rectangle rc = new Rectangle(2, 3);
            getAreaTest(rc);
            
            Rectangle sq = new Square();
            sq.setWidth(5);
            getAreaTest(sq);
        }
    }
Your team's tester just came up with the testing function getAreaTest and tells you that your getArea function fails to pass the test for square objects.

In the first test, we create a rectangle where the width is 2 and the height is 3 and call getAreaTest. The output is 20 as expected, but things go wrong when we pass in the square. This is because the call to setHeight function in the test is setting the width as well and results in an unexpected output.
